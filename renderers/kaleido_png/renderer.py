"""kaleido_png renderer.

Composition PNG -> Kaleido 3 colour PNG at the e-reader's screen dims:
24-bit RGB with every channel dithered to 16 levels (4096 colours), the
colour space of an E Ink Kaleido 3 panel (a colour filter array over
16-level greyscale glass: Kobo Libra Colour, Clara Colour, and other
colour readers KOReader drives).

Why a separate renderer from the KOReader kind's grey packers:

* ``esp32_gray_bin`` / ``esp32_gray2_bin`` / ``esp32_bw_bin`` pack a
  grey level per pixel into a raw buffer the plugin unpacks on the
  device. A colour reader could paint that, in grey, and throw away the
  one thing it was bought for.
* Kaleido has no short ink list to match against, so the indexed-PNG
  path the colour TRMNL renderer takes does not fit either: the panel
  reproduces any triple of 16-level channels, and the honest output is
  per-channel quantisation with error diffusion (see
  :func:`app.quantizer.quantize_kaleido3`), served as an ordinary RGB
  PNG. The KOReader plugin already handles ``format: "png"`` frames: it
  decodes them with the reader's image stack and blits the colour.

A device reaches this renderer by pairing with ``gamut: "kaleido3"`` (the
plugin announces that when KOReader reports a colour screen with colour
rendering on); ``app.device_service.renderer_id_for_gamut`` reads the
``gamuts`` list on the manifest and pins the instance here. The Kobo
colour hardware entries also list it first.

Orientation follows ``trmnl_png_gray16``: the finished composition is
turned onto the buffer the client reported (``native_w`` / ``native_h``
from a declared rotation or a hardware entry; the plugin reports its
screen as ``panel_w`` / ``panel_h``), 90 degrees CW when the aspects
disagree, 180 more for ``panel.flip``. Panels with no reported buffer
keep the composition dims.

The dither + contrast settings are flagged ``device_setting: true`` so
they live on the device card (Settings -> Devices -> Picture quality) and
each panel can be tuned independently.
